    <h2>Early life and accession</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which
       Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.[5][6][7] His younger brothers were Shakti Singh,
       Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort
        was Maharani Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia.[8] Their eldest son was Amar Singh I.[9] He belonged to the royal family of Mewar.
      [10] After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him[11] 
      but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and
     Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs.[12]
     He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, 
     and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his help.[1</p>

     <h2>Military career</h2>
     <hr>
     <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
     <p>Pratap Singh, gained distinction for his refusal to form any political alliance with the Mughal Empire
        and his resistance to Mughal domination. The conflicts between Pratap Singh and Akbar led to the Battle of Haldighati.</p>
     <h3><b>Battle of Haldighati</b></h3>
     <p>The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli range was still under the control of Maharana Pratap. Mughal Emperor Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh I of Amer, entreating him to become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused to personally submit to Akbar and several attempts to diplomatically settle the issue failed, war became inevitable.[16][17]

        The forces of Pratap Singh and Mughal and Rajput general Man Singh met on 18 June 1576 beyond a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. This came to be known as the Battle of Haldighati. Pratap Singh fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. Man Singh commanded an army numbering around 10,000 men.[18][19][20] After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours, Pratap found himself wounded and the day lost. He managed to retreat to the hills and lived to fight another day.[21] The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant casualties among the forces of Mewar but failed to capture Maharana Pratap.[18][19][20]
        
        Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to kill or capture Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur.[22] While the sources also claim that Pratap was able to make a successful escape, Man Singh managed to conquer Gogunda within a week after Haldighati then ended his campaign. Subsequently, Akbar himself led a sustained campaign against the Rana in September 1576, and soon, Gogunda, Udaipur, and Kumbhalgarh were all under Mughal control</p>
        
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident,[28] at Chavand[24] on 19 January 1597, aged 56.[29] He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. On his death bed, Pratap told his son never to submit to the Mughals and to win Chittor back</p>
